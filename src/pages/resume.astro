## Summary 
<div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-10 mb-5">
My name is Torsten Uhlmann, I'm a german software developer with a passion to create 
great and useful software.

I'm an experienced Java consultant with more than 25 years experience and successful 
projects in C++, Java, Ruby, Groovy, Scala and GO. My main focus is on enterprise 
software development and full stack web application development with technologies 
like Scala and Lift, Clojure or Typescript.

I authored the Lift Web Applications How-to: http://www.packtpub.com/lift-web-applications/book  
On my Github page you'll find numerous projects I've worked on over the last 
decade: https://github.com/tuhlmann

I enjoy meeting new people and facing new challenges.
I'm particularly good at integrating into teams and getting myself involved in the subject.
If you are looking for an accomplished software developer I'd love hearing from you.

Technologies have changed over time. One thing that steadily remained is my curiosity for new languages and methodologies.
I particularly enjoyed transitioning from being an imperative programmer with C++ and Java into using a more functional approach with Scala, Clojure and Typescript.

Current technologies:  
- DB: PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- languages: Scala, Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript, Typescript  
- web frameworks: Liftweb, AngularJS, MarkoJS, ReactJS
