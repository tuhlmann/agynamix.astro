Just now I released version 1.4.0 of Simidude, the cross platform network clipboard and drag & drop utility. I have added quite some features to it, for a complete list of new niceness please look [here](../blog/2009/simidude-140-release-notes/). The problems with the Windows 7 update installer are gone as well. Grab the latest release from our [download site](http://www.simidude.com/download/) and [tell](http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request) me what you think! Have a great day, Torsten.
