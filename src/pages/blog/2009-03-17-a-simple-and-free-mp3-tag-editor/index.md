I had some code laying around on my hard disk and thought it might be a good idea to clean it up and release it- so maybe this one is of help for others. I once had a need for a simple MP3 tag editor that I could throw a podcast file upon and have an easy way to change it's essential tags. It's a pretty easy tool, it comes with an easy to use installer. Just install, open it, choose a file, edit the tags, save the file and done. Nothing fancy, just useful :) Here's a screenshot of the thing: [![](http://blog.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/taginspector-300x241.jpg "TagInspector Screenshot")](./taginspector.jpg) Please note that TagInspector only runs on Windows and requires the .Net framework. I did this as a learning project to do something practically with C\#- before I put the books back in the shelf. Ah, right, here is the [download URL](http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html). While you're there you might want to check for other cool software, both free and commercial that I do offer... Have a great day, Torsten.
