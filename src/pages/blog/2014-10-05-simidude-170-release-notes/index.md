Simidude 1.7.0 Release Notes
============================

Today, I released version 1.7.0 of the Network Clipboard Simidude. After a long hiatus around Simidude I decided to release a new version, **completely free of charge**. If there is enough demand I will also open source the Simidude source code so others interested could take a peek and use it. As always, you can download the updated Simidude [here](http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/) and I suggest you do- it's now free for everyone. Have a great day, Torsten.
