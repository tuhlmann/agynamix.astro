I just released Dopus 0.9.12. Here is a not so precise list of some of the changes:

-   fixed some bugs with the SET docbook type
-   added more target hooks to the build process so you can customize more flexible
-   added a description (although very shallow I admit) of all available target hooks to the manual

Go [grab it](http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html) while it's hot :) Here's a short description of Dopus: "Dopus is a Docbook publishing framework. It was designed with portability and extensibility in mind. Dopus can run on any Windows or Unix platform that supports Java. We host Dopus here on our website as a free product that we want to give back to the Docbook community. The Dopus framework is distributed under the GNU General Public License. The various parts of the Dopus framework are distributed under their respective (free) licenses."Torsten.
