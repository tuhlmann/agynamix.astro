Recently, while listening to the [JavaPosse podcast](http://www.javaposse.com/) I learned about the [Google Collections API](http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/), a collections of enhancements to the original Java codebase. Not unlike [Apache commons collections](http://commons.apache.org/collections/) it enhances the Java programming experience in several ways. It's definetly worth checking out. There is a [fine tutorial](http://publicobject.com/2007/09/series-recap-coding-in-small-with.html) which explains parts of the API with code sample and explanations. Enjoy!
