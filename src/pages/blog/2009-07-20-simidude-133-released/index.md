A few days ago I release version 1.3.3 of Simidude, the cross platform network clipboard and drag & drop utility. And now, after I'm sure its [working this time](http://www.simidude.com/blog/2009/simidude-132-withdrawn-again/) I can even write about it :) This one is a maintenance release that doesn't add great new features but it fixes some bugs, renews used libraries and makes it all together more stable. A list of new features and bug fixes is available [here](http://www.simidude.com/blog/2009/simidude-13-release-notes/). However I did realize that the update installer for Windows 7 is not working. So when the update checker of Simidude notifies you of an update you can download it but the update installer will then fail (only Windows 7). You can then quit Simidude and start the downloaded installer by hand. I'm sure we'll figure that one out as well... Anyway, go grab the latest release from our [download site](http://www.simidude.com/download/) and have fun! Have a great day, Torsten.
