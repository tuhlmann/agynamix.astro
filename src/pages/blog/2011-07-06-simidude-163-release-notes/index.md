Simidude 1.6.3 Release Notes
============================

Today, I released version 1.6.3 of the Network Clipboard Simidude. This one is a maintenance release - it mainly fixes a few bugs. Simidude did crash on older Mac OS X versions because the new global shortcut handling on Mac depended on a library compiled for Snow Leopard. I fixed this so that crashes are no more (at least, not because of this). I also updated the libraries that Simidude depends on on all platforms which probably also fixed a few bugs... As always, you can download the updated Simidude [here](http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/) and I suggest you do- it's free for everyone with a license. Have a great day, Torsten.
